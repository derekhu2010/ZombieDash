# ZombieDash
In this project, I was required to implement a hierarchy of classes (Actors.h and Actors.cpp) to represent various game objects, such as a hero, different types of zombies and power-ups, pits, walls, etc., and use inheritance and polymorphism in a meaningful way to implement the functions of each class. I was also required to implement a class that would contain and keep track of all game objects (StudentWorld.h and StudentWorld.cpp). A graphics framework was provided by the professor. If you are a student currently enrolled in CS 32, copying code will result in violation of the academic honesty policies of the class.
